        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
            **Effective Date: July 15, 2025**
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-8">
            This Privacy Policy describes how MastApp ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application, MastApp, designed as a comprehensive resource for understanding and managing mastitis in dairy cattle.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-8">
            By using MastApp, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            MastApp is primarily an informational resource and is designed to minimize the collection of personal information. We collect information to improve the App's performance, understand user engagement, and ensure stability.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">a. Non-Personal Information / Usage Data</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            When you use MastApp, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information about your device and how you interact with the App. This information is aggregated and anonymized and does not directly identify you. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as your device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID, if applicable and permitted by user settings), and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the App, including the features you access, the content you view (e.g., which sections like "Clinical Signs" or "Prevention" are most popular), the time and date of your visits, and the duration of your sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Logs and Performance Data:</strong> Information about crashes, errors, and other performance issues, which helps us identify and fix bugs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">b. No Direct Personal Information Collection</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            MastApp does **not** directly collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, physical address, or any sensitive personal data related to your farming operations or individual animals. We do not require user accounts or logins for the core functionality of the App.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">c. Information from Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We may use third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, Google Play's own crash reporting) that may collect, monitor, and analyze this type of information to improve our App's functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The non-personal information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> Ensuring the App functions correctly and is available to you.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> Understanding user behavior and preferences to enhance features, content, and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Monitor Usage:</strong> Analyzing trends and statistics related to App usage.</li>
            <li><strong>To Detect and Address Technical Issues:</strong> Identifying and fixing bugs, crashes, and performance problems.</li>
            <li><strong>For Research and Analytics:</strong> To better understand the needs of our users and the effectiveness of our content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your non-personal information to outside parties. We may share non-personal, aggregated, or anonymized data with:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App, provide the App on our behalf, perform App-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our App is used (e.g., analytics providers, crash reporting services). These third parties have access to your non-personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Data Security</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The security of your information is important to us. We implement reasonable measures to protect the non-personal information we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We retain non-personal usage data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Crash logs and analytics data are typically retained for a period necessary for debugging and trend analysis.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            MastApp is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
